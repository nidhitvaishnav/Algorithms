For this challenge your task is to create a simple SELECT statement that will return all columns from the people table,
then join that result set to the sales table so that you can return the COUNT of all sales and RANK each person by their
sale_count. In case of ties, sort by id ascending.

SELECT people.id, people.name, COUNT(sales.id) as sale_count,
rank() OVER (ORDER BY count(sales.id) DESC) as sale_rank
from people inner join sales
on people.id = sales.people_id GROUP BY people.id
ORDER BY sale_count DESC, people.id ASC;
